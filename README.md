# Introduction-to-Julia
transition python ~> julia
To begin with, Julia is a scientific programming language mainly used for data science tasks because it's well suited for numerical analysis and computational science. Julia is syntactically similar to python and is likely as performant as C++ (in terms of speed)

In this repository, i will introduce some basic commands in Julia by analogy with Python features (such as functions, basic types, list comprehensions, exceptions, generators, modules, packages, and so on). In addition, i will do some elementary programs to train.

This repository will be updated regularly (as long as i'm leanring new stuff)
